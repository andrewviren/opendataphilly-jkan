# Adding and editing content

## How content is organized

JKAN content comprises categories, datasets, and organizations respectively, and these live in the following directories:
- `_dataset_categories`
- `_datasets`
- `_organizations`

## Adding content

In order to add an organization, for example, you just need to create a new markdown file under `_organizations` and fill it with YAML following the schema of the sample organization. Categories and Datasets work the same way but with their respective directories.

## Editing content

Editing is similarly just a matter of editing an existing markdown file.

## Test before posting a PR

Please test your changes locally before submitting a pull request. See the instructions for [running locally](running-locally.md), and make sure that any categories, datasets, or organizations that you create or edit look how you expect!
